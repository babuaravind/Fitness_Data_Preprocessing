Files:

\#\#\#run\_analysis.R This file contains the necessary source code to
process the raw dataset to the finished tidy dataset. It performs the
following instructions on the raw datset.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.

**CookBook.md** Contains documents each step of the data cleaning and
preprocessing process.

\#\#\#tidy-data-final.txt This is the actual file that has been
generated after following the aforementioned steps.
